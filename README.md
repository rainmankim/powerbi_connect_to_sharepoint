There are 3 main ways in which you can connect to Sharepoint Data:
Option 1. Connect from PowerBI to Sharepoint directly
Option 2. Connect from PowerBI to Sharepoint Excel
Option 3. Connect from PowerBI to synced OneDriver Folder
```

#### Before you proceed, you might want to clear existing permissions.
#### This is because if you have previously attempted to establish connection and failed, you need to delete your previous configuration
